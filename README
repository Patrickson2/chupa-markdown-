## The HTTP VERBS USED 
This project uses the following HTTP verbs:
- GET: To retrieve data from the server.
- POST: To send new data to the server.
- PUT: To update existing data on the server.
- DELETE: To remove data from the server.
- PATCH: To make partial updates to existing data on the server.
- OPTIONS: To describe the communication options for the target resource.
- HEAD: To retrieve the headers for a resource without the body.
- TRACE: To perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
- CONNECT: To establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
These verbs are essential for RESTful API design and help in defining the actions that can be performed on the resources.
