## The HTTP VERBS USED 
This project uses the following HTTP verbs:
- GET: To retrieve data from the server.
- POST: To send new data to the server.
- PUT: To update existing data on the server.
- DELETE: To remove data from the server.
- PATCH: To make partial updates to existing data on the server.
- OPTIONS: To describe the communication options for the target resource.
- HEAD: To retrieve the headers for a resource without the body.
- TRACE: To perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
- CONNECT: To establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
These verbs are essential for RESTful API design and help in defining the actions that can be performed on the resources.  

## Start of in creation of Flask and React 
To start a project with Flask as the backend and React as the frontend, follow these steps  
1. Set up the Flask Backend:
   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install Flask:
     ```bash
     pipenv install Flask
     ```
   - Create a basic Flask app (app.py):
     ```python
     from flask import Flask, jsonify

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET'])
     def get_data():
         return jsonify({"message": "Hello from Flask!"})

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```
